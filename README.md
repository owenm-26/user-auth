# Basic User Auth Project
I created this basic app to get better at connecting Reactjs to a database and using routing and middleware. I plan to use what I learned to make bigger projects.

## How to use
- Go into /client and run **npm start**
- Go into /server and run **npm run dev** in a new terminal
- Change the url from /register to /login after making an account

 ## Tech Stack
 - ReactJS
 - MongoDB
 - JWT
 - Express

  ## Future Plans
  I want to make the register page immediately take you to the login page and I want the whole thing to look better. But as I said before, this is more of a practice than anything.
